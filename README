brew install mysql
mysql -uroot

create a user

CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

grant all privileges

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';


The asterisks in this command refer to the database and table (respectively) that they can accessâ€”this specific command allows to the user to read, edit, execute and perform all tasks across all the databases and tables.
Once you have finalized the permissions that you want to set up for your new users, always be sure to reload all the privileges.


FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Appeared issue: Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' cannot be loaded


solution

ALTER USER 'arduino'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'arduino';
